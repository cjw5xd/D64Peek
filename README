D64Peek prints the contents of a Commodore 1541 disk image (more commonly known
as a D64 file) to the standard output. It works for both 35- and 40-track disks
with or without appended error bytes.

Sector data is also displayed in PETSCII form, allowing for easy inspection of
a program or data file's text contents.

Sample output using the default options:

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

-h    Show the help information and exit.

-p    Do not display PETSCII data.

-x    Display track and sector values in hexadecimal.



COMPILATION
-----------

On most Linux systems, simply running

  make

in the source directory will create the executable. If for whatever reason you
wish to compile it manually, try

  gcc -std=c99 main.c -o d64peek

or use whichever compiler is installed on your system.
